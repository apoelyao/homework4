We look at eigenvalues first, find the biggest one, and take a look at the correspond eigenvector
Find the largest extremevalue in the eigenvector and the corrspond company 
the company is the most influtiencial one
Then take a look at the sign
If the eigenvalues have the same sign
The company stock price increase/ decrease together
If they have different sign like[1,-1,-2,-3]
means when first company increase, other three decrease
